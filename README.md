# DirecTab
Python program that scans and scrapes property information of all files within a targeted path. Then automatically tabularizes and exports that information to excel with unique naming conventions to prevent file overwrites or copies.

This program was made as a solution to a problem that my CFO had involving constant monitoring around data/memory allocation and accumulation of company's folders and files. She wanted to know what folders and files, within our company's network, held the most occupation of data. This was offered as the first part of the solution.
