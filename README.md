# DirecTab
Python program that scans and scrapes property information of all files within a targeted path. Then automatically tabularizes and exports that information to excel with unique naming conventions to prevent file overwrites or copies.

This program was made as a solution to a problem that my CFO had involving constant monitoring around data/memory allocation and accumulation of company's folders and files. She wanted to know what folders and files, within our company's network, held the most occupation of data. This program would provide up to date information on the sizes of all folders and files within a targeted path. From there we were able to see what could be deleted, which files would be better allocated to other folders (based on size or relevance of the file), and what files or folders were newly added into the network.


# Limitations
Although its purpose is to scrape and tabularize property info of all files and folders within a targeted path, it will not be able to scrape files or folders that the program executor has access to. In this case, I was limited by my level of access that the company grants me within the network. But my CFO has over arching access within the network, the spread of the program in her hands was far wider.
